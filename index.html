                            It&#39;s common knowledge that China censors it&#39;s internet &#45; changing the way it&#39;s citizens access information and view the world. However, researchers are still trying to understand the anatomy of this censorship so that better international policies may be implemented.<br><br>

                            Our research team partnered with Professor Xiao at U.C. Berkeley&#39;s School of Information who has been amassing datasets that capture the impact of Chinese censorship. Our aim was to develop an interactive dashboard to help users better understand the types of sites were being censored and the methods of censorship China uses. We also hope this dashboard might be of use to the original researchers on Professor Xiao&#39;s team. Their ongoing work involves routinely assessing large data samples that might be easier to review in this visual format.
